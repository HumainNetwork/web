        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The well-being of individual strongly depends on the perception and actuality that one is cared for, has assistance and support available. Over the years insurance industry developed products delivering guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness or other triggers. All of this in return for payment of a specified premium. In other words - participants of the compensation guarantee finance the ones sustaining losses and the centralized institutions (insurance companies) ensure distribution of funds and prevention assurance. But the centralized infrastructure has several disadvantages: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Administration costs.</strong> Infrastructure as such must be administered and supervised, products distributed, premiums collected and claims distributed. All these costs sum up to 35% of premiums paid. In other words lost due to ineffectiveness of the system. </li>
                <li><strong>Lack of data openness.</strong> Data of policyholders and their risk performance is the comparative advantage of corporations. Its being used to compete in the market, but at the same time - generate profits for the stakeholders. Very rarely in small amounts, if ever, they are shared with the policyholders.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>HUMAIN change</h3>
        <div>The innovation of HUMAIN employs blockchain technology to substitute centralized institutions with the smart contracts. Significant reduction of administrative costs is being brought together with the distributed risk approach and data transparency. We are delivering infrastructure allowing members to create and spread supportive social networks. It is a full scale mutual backers environment, delivering human to human financial assistance. Along with financial assurance HUMAIN delivers a sense of confidence, increased life quality and well-being. </div>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        <h2>Values we bring</h2>
        <h3>Social behavior</h3>
        <div>Immediate family members have always been sources of trustful support. Their assistance is asked firstly. In many cases extended family members and best friends step in pulling out of trouble. Support from coworkers, neighbors or other familiar persons might be asked. Though in severe situations wider network of backers would always be handful. And they are ready to support. But instead of asking for help, HUMAIN empowers establishing a social commitment to support ones network.</div>
        <h3>Pure risk sharing</h3>
        <div>The technology behind HUMAIN delivers pure risk sharing without the need of a central institution. While insurance companies charge the risk with 35% of administrative costs, our solution grants significant costs reduction.</div>
        <h3>Verified members</h3>
        <div>Thorough identification of members is our priority delivering a trustful social network. Leading Secure Identity Platforms are being used to accept only verified identity members.</div>
        <h3>Fraud prevention</h3>
        <div>We have successfully invented the fraud prevention control. Our technology is based on the state of the art social proof concept. The more members you have in the network, the higher fraud prevention engages. </div>
        <h3>Transparency</h3>
        <div>We've created smart contracts being recorded into distributed digital ledger and shared across the network. The data of the contracts as well as risk effecting statistics is publicly available. We are charging 7%transaction fee only. No other hidden margins, costs or advantages included. </div>
        <h3>Insurance, Investment and holding in one</h3>
        <div>With Humain people are not only insure their friends and getting insurance for themself but in same time they're holding their Bitcoins for future. In a long run Bitcoin has tendention to go up, so it's could be very good investment as well.</div>
        <h3>Safety</h3>    
        <div>We're not holding bitcoins. Our smart-contracts does. So even if our company will go away, users will always be able to withdraw their funds.</div>
